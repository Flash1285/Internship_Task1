# üåê Network Discovery and Security Analysis Workshop

A step-by-step guide for performing a basic network scan, analyzing the results, and researching potential security vulnerabilities using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.

## üöÄ Phase 1: Installation

This phase covers the required tools for network scanning and packet analysis.

### 1. Install Nmap

Nmap (Network Mapper) is essential for network discovery and security auditing.

| Operating System | Download Link | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | [nmap-7.98-setup.exe](https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.98-setup.exe) | Use the installer to set up Nmap and Npcap. |
| **Linux (RPM)** | [nmap-7.98-1.x86_64.rpm](https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.98-1.x86_64.rpm) | **Alternative:** Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install nmap`). |
| **macOS** | [nmap-7.98.dmg](https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.98.dmg) | Mount the disk image and install the application. |

## üîç Phase 2: Network Scanning with Nmap

### 2. Find Local IP Range

Before scanning, determine your local network's IP address and range.

| Operating System | Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linux/macOS** | `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` | Shows network interface configurations and your local IP. |
| **Windows** | `ipconfig` | Shows network configuration, including the IPv4 address. |

Use your local IP (e.g., `192.168.171.128`) to determine the subnet range (e.g., `192.168.171.0/24`).

### 3. Perform TCP SYN Scan

Execute a fast, stealthy scan across your local subnet to discover active hosts and open ports.

```bash
# Replace the IP range with your actual subnet
nmap -sS 192.168.171.128/24

### 4. Note IP Addresses and Open Ports

Record the active **IP addresses** and associated **open ports** identified during the Nmap scan.

### 5. Analyze Packet Capture with Wireshark

Use **Wireshark** to capture and inspect the network traffic (specifically the TCP SYN/SYN-ACK packets) generated during the Nmap scan for a detailed view of the communication process.

| Operating System | Download Link | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | [Wireshark-4.6.0-x64.exe](https://2.na.dl.wireshark.org/win64/Wireshark-4.6.0-x64.exe) | Official 64-bit installer. |
| **macOS** | [Wireshark 4.6.0.dmg](https://2.na.dl.wireshark.org/osx/Wireshark%204.6.0.dmg) | Official macOS disk image. |
| **Linux** | [Launchpad PPA Link](https://launchpad.net/~wireshark-dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable) | The recommended method is typically through the distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install wireshark`). |

### 6. Research Common Services Running on Those Ports

For each noted open port (e.g., 22, 80, 443), research the default services associated with them.

* **Tools:** Utilize AI and search engines (like Google) to find information on the services, protocols, and common configurations.

### 7. Identify Potential Security Risks

Research the common security risks, vulnerabilities, and potential exploits associated with the identified open services and ports.

* **Resources:** Search platforms like **MITRE ATT&CK** and security blogs (like Medium) for information on known exploits.
